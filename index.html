The website must include all pages from the site architecture and be developed with clean, semantic HTML and CSS following the DRY principle. No CSS frameworks like Bootstrap should be used, as the focus is on building responsive layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid. Eventually, on another submission, we included javaScript on the website. Using API calls to display images, titles and prices.<br> <br>
                                Accessibility and WCAG compliance are essential, and every page must have unique meta tags and headings. Code validation and browser testing are also key steps before submission, ensuring the website is bug-free, accessible, and performs well across devices.</span></p>

The website should be informative, visually appealing, and encourage curiosity without oversimplifying the content. The design must reflect the interests of the target audience, blending creativity with technical expertise learned during the first semester. Here I implemented my drawing skill and drew the logo and the icons my self.<br><br> The site must consist of 4-6 pages, use semantic HTML, and follow the DRY principle in its external CSS. Key considerations include WCAG accessibility, SEO best practices, and content strategy. The website must load efficiently and function seamlessly across different devices. Final delivery includes a live URL, GitHub repository, and a report detailing the design and technical decisions, along with adherence to WCAG, SEO, and content management guidelines.</span></p>

The blog site must include a home page with a ‘Latest Posts’ carousel, an about page, a list of blog posts, individual blog post pages, and a contact page with form validation. The site’s content will be managed through a WordPress installation, used as a Headless CMS, and data will be fetched via the WordPress REST API. The blog must contain at least 12 posts, with dynamically built blog-specific pages.<br><br> Key features include image modals, a blog list load-more function, and client-side form validation using JavaScript. The project will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed to Netlify, with progress tracked on GitHub. Hotjar will be installed for user testing, with feedback integrated into the final version. The exam also requires a report documenting the development process and adherence to best practices.</span>

            ABOUT
        </h2>
        <p  class="history-about lead text-white mb-5 p-3">On an island outside Bergen lives a man who wants to create, who wants to learn, who wants to get inspired and who wants to make new connections with people!<br><br>
        
        I have various experience in my work life. I started work early on, and left for the army at age 19. While I was in the army, I took a course to be a security guard when I was done.  And so I did. Two days after I left the army, at Værnes Garnison, I got my first job. I worked night time in Bergen City at a company named Hafslund Sikkerhet.  <br> Fast forward, I ended up doing a lot of "security guarding", and even worked at the local airport.
        <br>
        For five years I worked at Loomis, where I managed and transported money and other values. <br><br>
        After that, I have worked for Mjøs Metallvarefabrikk, where I cast vacuum pump parts mainly for Jets Vacuum.<br><br>
        But now, after many years doing this kind of work, I needed to invest and educate myself. So, after a lot of time thinking about it and looked at my options, I spoke to one of my friends. He suggested frontend development. I read about it, and saw for the first time many bulletpoints who matched my interests. <br>I have always been creative and enjoy the art of creating. So this was very inspiring to discover. Now, two years later, I have created three websites as a student, and I am always looking forward to the next. I also try to have side projects, so you may see something new here eventually!
